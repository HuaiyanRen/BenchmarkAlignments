    notes: This is the dataset with excluded sites removed. The alignment file is "5284taxa_ML_alignment_exclude.txt" from this download https://datadryad.org/bitstream/handle/10255/dryad.203726/Varga_2019_NEE_5284taxa_MaximumLikelihood_analysis.zip?sequence=1. Illegal nexus characters in the alignment (e.g. '/') were replaced with underscores. It was not possible to identify all outgroup species from the published manuscript.
