Notes on a lunchtime discussion on this database from the Phylogenetics meeting at Portobello in 2015

## Metadata to include:

For each metric, include
1. Overall for whole alignment (e.g. GC_all)
2. Largest (e.g. GC_max)
3. Smallest (e.g. GC_min)
4. Median (e.g. GC_med)
5. Variation (e.g. GC_var: stdev? 95%CI?)

## Metrics to inlcude
1. Base composition (just for overall alignment, i.e. counts of every symbol after to.upper())
2. GC content
3. GC skew
4. Pairwise JC distance
5. Proportion of gaps per row
6. Proportion of gaps per column
7. Branch lengths (possibly, from e.g. NJ tree using fast NJ or something similar)
8. Matt Phillips' RCV measure - which is about base frequency variance
9. Matt Phillips' Stemminess measure - which is about the shape of the tree

## Branch lengths (possibly, but it means inferring a tree)
1. Median branch length
2. Smallest branch length
3. Longest branch length
4. Slope of regression of log(branch depth) vs. log(branch length) - tells you if smaller branches are deeper in the tree or towards the tips

## Time information
1. Dates on all sequences in a .csv file ('NA' for contemporary seqs, be careful with units for e.g. viruses versus aDNA)
2. Rough age of root of the tree from e.g. TimeTree.org
3. Outgroup taxa (or split defining the root)

## Label names
1. Might be useful (though a lot of work) to curate label names carefully so you could distinguish members of same species. Esp. for coalescent type datasets. Alternative - restrict database to datasets for which the original authors assumed there was a single bifurcating tree that applied to all the data in the alignment. 

## Simulated data
1. Simulated dataset of the same size, assuming rooted ML tree and ML GTR+I+G parameters, no gaps
2. As for (1), but with original gaps ('-' assumed, not 'N', need to check '?') overlaid on data

## Taxon sampling
1. Viruses
2. Bacteria
3. Archaea
4. Animals
5. Fungi
6. Plants
