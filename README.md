# BenchmarkAlignments

## What's this?

A curated repository of DNA and amino acid alignments with comprehensive metadata.

## What's it for?

To test, verify, benchmark, and compare software and methods in phylogenetics.

## Getting the data

The data are stored at figShare, so first we need to download and unpack it.

You can do it by hand by clicking 'Download All' at this link: https://figshare.com/s/622e9e0a156e5233944b, and then extracting each of the `.tar.gz` files yourself.

If you are comfortable with the commandline, you can do it like this

```{shell}
# make the directory to keep it in
mkdir BenchmarkAlignments
cd BenchmarkAlignemnts

# download and unzip the data
curl https://ndownloader.figshare.com/articles/7092356?private_link=622e9e0a156e5233944b > BenchmarkAlignments.zip
unzip BenchmarkAlignments.zip

# unpack the .tar.gz files
find . -name "*.tar.gz" -exec tar xzf {} \;

# clean up
rm *.tar.gz
rm *.zip
```

You should now have a series of folders named e.g. `Anderson_2013`. This is the database.


# What's in each folder?

Inside each folder is:

1.  **`README.yaml`**: a YAML file which has metadata on the alignment including but not limited to: the license, DOIs for the original study and the dataset, notes on the dataset itself.

2.  **`alignment.nex`**: a nexus formatted alignment file that contains the sequence alignment in non-interleaved nexus format, plus a SETS block which contains information on partitions, genomes, and outgroups.

3. **`alignment.nex-summary.txt`**: summary stats on the whole alignment generated by [AMAS](https://github.com/marekborowiec/AMAS). 

4. **`alignment.nex-seq-summary.txt`**: summary stats on each sequence in the alignment generated by [AMAS](https://github.com/marekborowiec/AMAS).


# Can I use these datasets?
Yes. All of the original datasets are publicly available and can be re-used. The datasets themselves are all released under a CC0 or CCBY license.

Everything here and on figShare that is not a dataset (e.g. the `summary.csv` file, `README.yaml`, the code here) is released under a CC-BY license.

# Attribution

If you use any of the datasets, please make sure to reference three things:

1.  The original study (the full reference and DOI are provided in `README.yaml`)

2.  The dataset itself (the DOI is provided in `README.yaml`)

3.  This repository (github.com/roblanf/BenchmarkAlignments)

This is essential to reward and acknowledge those who spend weeks and months in the field, laboriously chasing frogs/flies/lizards etc., then are kind enough to share their data with the world so that people like me (and you, if you're reading this) can re-use them for other things.

# I have something to say

If you find errors, bugs, or have suggested datasets or features, please leave suggestions on the issue tracker here: https://github.com/roblanf/BenchmarkAlignments/issues
