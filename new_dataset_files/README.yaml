        taxon ID: [a GenBank Taxon ID, which should be an integer that resolves without a 404 when you add it to the end of this URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=, e.g. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=27563]
    notes: ['NA', or some text, for example if the dataset DOI points to lots of datasets, we need to know which one we have here]
